│   └── medium_original.jpg
```

**After:**
```
AWS S3
├── media/
│   ├── profile_photos/{user_id}/
│   │   ├── {filename}_original.{ext}
│   │   ├── thumbnails/{filename}_thumb.{ext}
│   │   └── medium/{filename}_medium.{ext}
│   ├── chat/{user_id}/

```

### File Processing Pipeline

**Before:**
1. Store file locally
2. Generate thumbnails locally
3. Save thumbnails locally
4. Return local URLs

**After:**
1. Validate file (type, size, format)
2. Process image with Intervention Image
3. Upload original to S3
4. Generate and upload thumbnails to S3
5. Return S3 URLs with metadata

### Error Handling
